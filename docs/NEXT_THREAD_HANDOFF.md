# Next Thread Handoff

Date: 2026-07-04
Active repo: `https://github.com/akassh9/vidura-labs`
Canonical local workspace: `/Users/akash009/vidura`

## CTO Direction

Vidura Labs is a native macOS physics research companion, starting with
HEP/Pythia. The product thesis is not "chat with a model"; it is "ask for a
physics analysis and receive a reproducible scientific run record."

Strategic decisions:

- macOS first.
- Drop the old CLI direction.
- Do not reintroduce the old hackathon sponsored-provider stack.
- Use OpenAI for model-backed agent stages.
- Keep local Pythia execution and local SQLite persistence.
- Treat generated code, logs, plots, run metadata, replayability, and export as
  product surface.

## Current Baseline

The source-of-truth repo is the private GitHub repo:

```text
https://github.com/akassh9/vidura-labs
```

The canonical local checkout at `/Users/akash009/vidura` points at
`akassh9/vidura-labs`. Older public-repo checkouts were archived under
`/Users/akash009/vidura-legacy-archive-*`. Always verify `git remote -v` before
creating a branch or PR.

Local `.env` contains `OPENAI_API_KEY`. It is ignored. Never print it.

Run path:

```bash
./script/build_and_run.sh build
./script/build_and_run.sh --verify
```

Process IDs drift, so verify launches with:

```bash
pgrep -x "Vidura Labs"
```

## GitHub Workflow

Implementation agents should:

- start from current `main` on `akassh9/vidura-labs`,
- create a `codex/` branch,
- make the scoped change,
- run validation,
- push the branch,
- open a PR,
- report the PR URL, validation, smoke run IDs, secret/artifact checks, and
  known gaps.

Do not push directly to `main`. The CTO/user verifies and merges PRs.

## Already Completed

Provider/runtime migration:

- Removed Firebase app initialization and package/resource references.
- Removed stale provider-specific generated pipeline diagrams.
- Added `OpenAIClient.swift` for OpenAI Responses API calls, structured outputs,
  and local `.env` credential resolution.
- Rewired guide, intent, codegen, summary, and thread naming stages to OpenAI.
- Preserved deterministic fallbacks where they already made sense.

Persistence fixes:

- Fixed `messages.sender` loading in `ResearchStore`.
- Removed the dead `chat_history` write path.
- Fixed branch-run message copying into normalized `messages`.
- Prevented follow-up parent links from crossing unrelated runs.

Multi-chart slice:

- `PlottingAgent.runAll(...)` emits multiple `ChartPayload`s.
- `OrchestratorService` persists multiple chart messages per run and chains the
  summary after the last chart.
- `PhysicsSummaryAgent` receives all chart payloads.
- `RunnerService` collects `hist_pt.txt` and future `hist_*.txt` artifacts.
- `AnalysisPlannerAgent` includes secondary artifact filenames in the output
  contract when requested.
- Five-column histogram parsing uses `bin_center` for x and `count` for y.

Run Evidence / Provenance slice:

- Successful runs persist evidence artifacts for `run.cc`,
  `simulation_spec.json`, `summary.json`, `summary_lines.txt`, `compile.log`,
  `run.log`, and plot/table outputs.
- The old source-only `Run Configurations` panel was replaced with a `Run
  Evidence` surface.
- Added grouped artifact sections, read-only artifact viewing, Copy Path, Reveal
  in Finder, Copy Run ID, and Reveal Run Folder.
- Added fallback disk discovery for historical runs under Application Support.

Smoke-gated reproducible runs:

- Fresh smoke run `55C18C16-54E4-4A3C-BFFE-DEEE030A7459` completed with
  `event_count=10000`.
- Persisted two chart messages: `Charged Multiplicity` and
  `Transverse Momentum Spectrum`.
- Persisted evidence for `run.cc`, `simulation_spec.json`, `summary.json`,
  `summary_lines.txt`, `compile.log`, `run.log`, `hist_primary.txt`, and
  `hist_pt.txt`.
- Added `OrchestratorService.rerunExact(run:)`.
- Exact rerun uses persisted `simulation_spec.json` and `run.cc`, bypassing
  OpenAI guide/intent/codegen.
- Verified exact rerun `98CA353A-941B-4B5A-B6A6-070D89FDE59F` with byte-equal
  `run.cc` and `simulation_spec.json`.

Run Compare:

- PR #1: `https://github.com/akassh9/vidura-labs/pull/1`
- Merged at `6e744a9d40a92513239c970118313e0665a43241`.
- Adds a Compare tab beside Run Evidence.
- Compares two completed runs in the current thread across identity,
  configuration, summary metrics, artifact presence, chart titles/point counts,
  and byte-level `run.cc`/`simulation_spec.json` equality.
- Validation before merge:
  - `./script/build_and_run.sh build` succeeded.
  - `./script/build_and_run.sh --verify` succeeded.
  - `pgrep -x "Vidura Labs"` confirmed launch.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - Secret/artifact tracked-file scan was clean.

Export Run Bundle:

- PR #3: `https://github.com/akassh9/vidura-labs/pull/3`
- Merged at `5bb22ac5764bcb819fcb1e33e079dde391568210`.
- Adds an Export Run Bundle action to completed Run Evidence cards.
- Folder export writes `manifest.json` and `run_report.md`.
- Copies run evidence only: `run.cc`, `simulation_spec.json`, summaries, logs,
  and plot/table artifacts.
- Manifest includes run identity, configuration, flattened
  `simulation_spec.json`, flattened `summary.json` metrics, chart titles/point
  counts, copied artifacts, missing artifact references, and missing expected
  artifacts.
- Uses existing `RunEvidenceResolver`; no OpenAI calls.
- Smoke bundle inspected for run `55C18C16-54E4-4A3C-BFFE-DEEE030A7459`.
- Validation before merge:
  - `./script/build_and_run.sh build` succeeded.
  - `./script/build_and_run.sh --verify` succeeded.
  - `pgrep -x "Vidura Labs"` confirmed launch.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - Secret/artifact tracked-file scan was clean.

Parameterized Rerun:

- PR #6: `https://github.com/akassh9/vidura-labs/pull/6`
- Merged at `459a37f32f15b7e50d1925a1ac69b397bb746193`.
- Adds a Parameterized Rerun action to completed Run Evidence cards.
- Loads persisted `simulation_spec.json`, applies controlled changes, and
  regenerates deterministic C++ with `CodegenAgent`.
- Supports event count, random seed, and `PhaseSpace:pTHatMin`.
- Creates a sibling run in the same thread and records source-run provenance in
  configuration:
  - `Vidura:variantOfRunID`
  - `Vidura:variantChanges`
  - `Vidura:variantCodegen`
- Bypasses OpenAI guide/intent/codegen. The existing post-run physics summary
  stage still follows the normal path.
- Smoke validation:
  - Source run: `55C18C16-54E4-4A3C-BFFE-DEEE030A7459`.
  - Variant run: `B28DBDBC-B49D-4F40-AC6B-7F85113744B1`.
  - Tested `event_count 10000 -> 200`, `seed 625434 -> 13579`,
    `PhaseSpace:pTHatMin unset -> 18.5`.
  - Variant completed with modified `simulation_spec.json`, deterministic
    `run.cc`, `summary.json`, logs, `hist_primary.txt`, `hist_pt.txt`, two
    chart messages, and evidence artifacts.
  - Export manifest for the variant included two charts, all expected artifacts,
    and no missing artifacts.
- Validation before merge:
  - `./script/build_and_run.sh build` succeeded.
  - `./script/build_and_run.sh --verify` succeeded.
  - `pgrep -x "Vidura Labs"` confirmed launch.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - Tracked-file and diff secret scans were clean.

## Next Product Slice

Run Lineage & Reproducibility Surface.

Why this next: exact rerun, parameterized rerun, compare, and export now work,
but they are still separate actions. A user needs to see how runs relate: which
run is the source, which are exact reruns, which are variants, what changed, and
what comparison/export action makes sense next.

## Recommended Implementation

Keep this slice inside the current data model unless a hard blocker appears.
Use existing configuration keys, titles, messages, and evidence to infer
lineage. Add schema only if the existing run/message/artifact data cannot support
the UI.

Suggested shape:

- Add a `RunLineageResolver` near the Run Evidence/Compare code or as a small
  local helper.
- Detect variant relationships from `Vidura:variantOfRunID`.
- Add exact-rerun provenance going forward by setting a configuration key such
  as `Vidura:exactRerunOfRunID` inside `OrchestratorService.rerunExact(run:)`.
- For historical exact reruns, infer cautiously from the request message
  `Rerun exact from run <id>` when available.
- In Run Evidence cards, show a compact reproducibility row:
  - source run short ID,
  - type: original, exact rerun, or variant,
  - variant changes when present.
- Add a direct "Compare to Source" action for exact reruns and variants. It
  should switch the side panel to Compare and preselect source + derived run.
- In Run Compare, surface relationship context when the selected pair is a
  source/derived pair.
- Keep Export Run Bundle and both rerun actions working.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Variants show their source run and parameter changes in the Evidence surface.
- New exact reruns record their source run in configuration.
- Historical exact reruns still show a best-effort source relationship when it
  can be inferred from existing messages.
- Derived runs have a one-click Compare to Source path.
- Run Compare labels source/derived relationships when applicable.
- Existing Evidence and Compare behavior still works.
- Existing Exact Rerun, Parameterized Rerun, and Export Run Bundle behavior
  still works.
- `./script/build_and_run.sh build` succeeds.
- `./script/build_and_run.sh --verify` succeeds.
- Branch is pushed and a PR is opened against `akassh9/vidura-labs/main`.

## Useful Commands

```bash
git remote -v
git status --short --branch
./script/build_and_run.sh build
./script/build_and_run.sh --verify
pgrep -x "Vidura Labs"
```

Inspect latest runs:

```bash
sqlite3 -header -column "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.AL.PhysicsCompanion/research.db" \
  "SELECT id, title, status, event_count, updated_at FROM runs ORDER BY datetime(updated_at) DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

Inspect messages for a run:

```bash
sqlite3 -header -column "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.AL.PhysicsCompanion/research.db" \
  "SELECT id, sender, role, length(content) AS content_len, length(chart_payload) AS chart_len, created_at FROM messages WHERE run_id = '<RUN_ID>' ORDER BY datetime(created_at);"
```

Inspect artifacts for a run:

```bash
sqlite3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.AL.PhysicsCompanion/research.db" \
  "SELECT artifacts FROM runs WHERE id = '<RUN_ID>';" | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Guardrails

- Do not redo provider migration.
- Do not reintroduce Firebase/Gemini.
- Do not restart CLI work.
- Do not print `.env`.
- Do not commit local databases, DerivedData, generated simulation folders, or
  exported run bundles.
- Do not revert unrelated user or agent changes.
- Back up live Application Support DB before manual data patching.
- Keep export deterministic and evidence-driven; do not call OpenAI for export.
