# Next Thread Handoff

Active repo: `https://github.com/akassh9/vidura-labs`
Working clone used for PRs: `/Users/akash009/vidura-labs-pr`

## CTO Direction

Vidura Labs is a native macOS physics research companion, starting with
HEP/Pythia. The product thesis is not "chat with a model"; it is "ask for a
physics analysis and receive a reproducible scientific run record."

Strategic decisions:

- macOS first.
- Drop the old CLI direction.
- Do not reintroduce the old hackathon sponsored-provider stack.
- Use OpenAI for model-backed agent stages.
- Keep local Pythia execution and local SQLite persistence.
- Treat generated code, logs, plots, run metadata, replayability, and export as
  product surface.

## Current Baseline

The source-of-truth repo is the private GitHub repo:

```text
https://github.com/akassh9/vidura-labs
```

Older local clones may still point at `Alfagov/ViduraLabs`. Always verify
`git remote -v` before creating a branch or PR.

Local `.env` contains `OPENAI_API_KEY`. It is ignored. Never print it.

Run path:

```bash
./script/build_and_run.sh build
./script/build_and_run.sh --verify
```

Process IDs drift, so verify launches with:

```bash
pgrep -x "Vidura Labs"
```

## GitHub Workflow

Implementation agents should:

- start from current `main` on `akassh9/vidura-labs`,
- create a `codex/` branch,
- make the scoped change,
- run validation,
- push the branch,
- open a PR,
- report the PR URL, validation, smoke run IDs, secret/artifact checks, and
  known gaps.

Do not push directly to `main`. The CTO/user verifies and merges PRs.

## Already Completed

Provider/runtime migration:

- Removed Firebase app initialization and package/resource references.
- Removed stale provider-specific generated pipeline diagrams.
- Added `OpenAIClient.swift` for OpenAI Responses API calls, structured outputs,
  and local `.env` credential resolution.
- Rewired guide, intent, codegen, summary, and thread naming stages to OpenAI.
- Preserved deterministic fallbacks where they already made sense.

Persistence fixes:

- Fixed `messages.sender` loading in `ResearchStore`.
- Removed the dead `chat_history` write path.
- Fixed branch-run message copying into normalized `messages`.
- Prevented follow-up parent links from crossing unrelated runs.

Multi-chart slice:

- `PlottingAgent.runAll(...)` emits multiple `ChartPayload`s.
- `OrchestratorService` persists multiple chart messages per run and chains the
  summary after the last chart.
- `PhysicsSummaryAgent` receives all chart payloads.
- `RunnerService` collects `hist_pt.txt` and future `hist_*.txt` artifacts.
- `AnalysisPlannerAgent` includes secondary artifact filenames in the output
  contract when requested.
- Five-column histogram parsing uses `bin_center` for x and `count` for y.

Run Evidence / Provenance slice:

- Successful runs persist evidence artifacts for `run.cc`,
  `simulation_spec.json`, `summary.json`, `summary_lines.txt`, `compile.log`,
  `run.log`, and plot/table outputs.
- The old source-only `Run Configurations` panel was replaced with a `Run
  Evidence` surface.
- Added grouped artifact sections, read-only artifact viewing, Copy Path, Reveal
  in Finder, Copy Run ID, and Reveal Run Folder.
- Added fallback disk discovery for historical runs under Application Support.

Smoke-gated reproducible runs:

- Fresh smoke run `55C18C16-54E4-4A3C-BFFE-DEEE030A7459` completed with
  `event_count=10000`.
- Persisted two chart messages: `Charged Multiplicity` and
  `Transverse Momentum Spectrum`.
- Persisted evidence for `run.cc`, `simulation_spec.json`, `summary.json`,
  `summary_lines.txt`, `compile.log`, `run.log`, `hist_primary.txt`, and
  `hist_pt.txt`.
- Added `OrchestratorService.rerunExact(run:)`.
- Exact rerun uses persisted `simulation_spec.json` and `run.cc`, bypassing
  OpenAI guide/intent/codegen.
- Verified exact rerun `98CA353A-941B-4B5A-B6A6-070D89FDE59F` with byte-equal
  `run.cc` and `simulation_spec.json`.

Run Compare:

- PR #1: `https://github.com/akassh9/vidura-labs/pull/1`
- Merged at `6e744a9d40a92513239c970118313e0665a43241`.
- Adds a Compare tab beside Run Evidence.
- Compares two completed runs in the current thread across identity,
  configuration, summary metrics, artifact presence, chart titles/point counts,
  and byte-level `run.cc`/`simulation_spec.json` equality.
- Validation before merge:
  - `./script/build_and_run.sh build` succeeded.
  - `./script/build_and_run.sh --verify` succeeded.
  - `pgrep -x "Vidura Labs"` confirmed launch.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
  - Secret/artifact tracked-file scan was clean.

## Next Product Slice

Export Run Bundle.

Why this next: evidence, exact rerun, and compare make a run inspectable inside
the app. Export makes a run portable. A completed simulation should become a
self-contained folder that can be shared with another physicist, archived with a
paper/notebook, or attached to an issue without depending on the live SQLite DB.

## Recommended Implementation

Add an export action for completed simulation runs from the Run Evidence surface.
Keep the first implementation narrow and folder-based; Swift has no standard zip
API, and a correct folder export is more valuable than a brittle custom archive.

The exported folder should include:

- `manifest.json`
- `README.md` or `run_report.md`
- `run.cc`
- `simulation_spec.json`
- `summary.json`
- `summary_lines.txt`
- `compile.log`
- `run.log`
- plot/table artifacts such as `hist_primary.txt` and `hist_pt.txt`

`manifest.json` should include at least:

- export format version,
- export timestamp,
- app/project name if available,
- thread ID and run ID,
- run title/status/event count,
- run created/updated timestamps,
- simulation spec metadata if available,
- summary metrics if available,
- chart titles and point counts if available,
- artifact list with relative paths, byte sizes, and source artifact type.

Use persisted evidence first. Preserve fallback disk discovery for historical
runs where possible.

For macOS UX, prefer a normal folder destination flow. If that is too large for
the first slice, export to a deterministic Application Support `exports/<run-id>`
folder and expose Copy Path / Reveal in Finder.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A completed run can be exported without using OpenAI.
- The exported bundle is self-contained and excludes secrets, local DB files,
  DerivedData, and unrelated Application Support state.
- Missing optional artifacts are reported in the UI or manifest without failing
  the whole export.
- The bundle includes a human-readable report and a machine-readable manifest.
- Existing Evidence and Compare behavior still works.
- `./script/build_and_run.sh build` succeeds.
- `./script/build_and_run.sh --verify` succeeds.
- Branch is pushed and a PR is opened against `akassh9/vidura-labs/main`.

## Useful Commands

```bash
git remote -v
git status --short --branch
./script/build_and_run.sh build
./script/build_and_run.sh --verify
pgrep -x "Vidura Labs"
```

Inspect latest runs:

```bash
sqlite3 -header -column "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.AL.PhysicsCompanion/research.db" \
  "SELECT id, title, status, event_count, updated_at FROM runs ORDER BY datetime(updated_at) DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

Inspect messages for a run:

```bash
sqlite3 -header -column "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.AL.PhysicsCompanion/research.db" \
  "SELECT id, sender, role, length(content) AS content_len, length(chart_payload) AS chart_len, created_at FROM messages WHERE run_id = '<RUN_ID>' ORDER BY datetime(created_at);"
```

Inspect artifacts for a run:

```bash
sqlite3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.AL.PhysicsCompanion/research.db" \
  "SELECT artifacts FROM runs WHERE id = '<RUN_ID>';" | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Guardrails

- Do not redo provider migration.
- Do not reintroduce Firebase/Gemini.
- Do not restart CLI work.
- Do not print `.env`.
- Do not commit local databases, DerivedData, generated simulation folders, or
  exported run bundles.
- Do not revert unrelated user or agent changes.
- Back up live Application Support DB before manual data patching.
- Keep export deterministic and evidence-driven; do not call OpenAI for export.
